# Base Converter
A small GTK app which performs base conversions between binary, decimal, and hexidecimal.

I was interested in learning how to build GTK applications so I decided a good place to start was a small stand-alone program.

The user may select which conversion to perform along with how many bits to consider by using the drop down menu.
Input is entered in the topmost text box, while the results are printed in the box directly below.

### To Use:

In your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/StrictTangent/baseconverter.git
cd baseconverter
make
./baseconverter
```
